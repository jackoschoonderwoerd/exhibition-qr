    <h2>How the App Works on Different Devices</h2>

    <p>
        This application is built as a <strong>Progressive Web App (PWA)</strong>.
        It runs in a web browser but can also be installed on a phone or tablet and
        used like a native app.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation &amp; Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Visitors open the app using a regular web browser.</li>
        <li>They can choose to install the app on their device.</li>
        <li>Once installed, the app:
            <ul>
                <li>Opens from an icon on the home screen</li>
                <li>Runs full-screen without browser menus</li>
                <li>Feels and behaves like a native app</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Camera &amp; QR Code Scanning</h3>
    <p>
        The app includes a built-in QR code scanner, so visitors do not need a
        separate scanning app.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On most devices, the camera works immediately after permission is granted.</li>
        <li>On iPhones and iPads:
            <ul>
                <li>The system asks for extra confirmation to use the camera</li>
                <li>This is a standard security feature of iOS</li>
                <li>After permission is granted, the scanner works as expected</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Important Note About iPhones (iOS)</h3>
    <p>
        On Apple devices, all installed web apps use Apple’s own underlying technology.
        This ensures strong security and privacy, but also means that camera access
        rules are stricter than on some other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app has been designed and tested to work reliably within these rules.
    </p>

    <h3>What This Means for Visitors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No app store download required</li>
        <li>No account needed</li>
        <li>The phone’s own camera is used safely and with permission</li>
        <li>Works on modern smartphones and tablets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What This Means for the Organization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One app works across platforms</li>
        <li>No separate iOS or Android development needed</li>
        <li>Updates are available immediately, without app store approval</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The app works in the browser and as an installed app</li>
        <li>QR codes open the correct artifact instantly</li>
        <li>The scanner uses the device camera in a secure, privacy-friendly way</li>
        <li>Minor differences between devices are normal and expected</li>
    </ul>
